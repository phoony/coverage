                Help us shape the future of API testing tools! We are conducting a survey to gather insights from
                developers like <b>you</b> to create a prototype tool that reports on the test coverage of your API
                based on
                your test suite.
            </p>

            <h3>The Goal: Usable data about the quality of your test suite!</h3>

                        <p>An API contract, such as <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> outlines the
                            structure and behavior of APIs. It specifies the available <b>operations</b>, their
                            <b>locations</b>, and
                            the required <b>parameters</b>. When properly defined, it allows consumers to understand and
                            interact with a remote service without needing to know its internal workings. These
                            descriptions can automatically generate documentation and server or client stubs.

                        <p>Often APIs come with their own <b>test suite</b> which focuses on testing the APIs behavior.
                            The
                            developers could for example write a simple test client that calls certain API functions via
                            HTTP and verifies that the server responds as expected. This is mostly testing the domain
                            logic but can also test different behaviors such as error handling or performance.</p>

                            The execution of the API tests generates valuable traffic data. The traffic contains
                            information about which endpoints are called, with which parameters and how often. This data
                            can be used to generate statistics that show how thoroughly the API is tested. <b>The best
                                thing is: this is completely language agnostic </b> since it only relies on the raw HTTP
                            traffic. The goal of this work is to <b> create a tool </b> that does exactly that: <b>
                                analyze
                                the traffic data and <b>generate a report that shows how well the API is covered</b>.

                        <p><b>API Coverage is a collection of metrics that measures the degree to which an API is
                                tested</b>. These metrics can vary depending on their definition and purpose. The
                            important
                            thing is that they give an idea of how well the API is tested and where the gaps are. The
                            goal
                            is that the generated coverage data can be used to help developers improve their test suite.

                            <b>A desirable outcome</b> would be to find a positive correlation between API Test Coverage
                            and the
                            robustness
                            of the API. Equally desirable would be a correlation between API Test Coverage and found
                            bugs in the API implementation. This could be used to predict the quality of the API based
                            on the test coverage.
